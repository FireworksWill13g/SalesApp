SHORTCUTS in Visual Studio
	Format section: ctrl+K+D

CONNECTING TO A (one) MODEL
	You Need one Property for the Model itself and one property for the model's ID 

	Ex: 
		public virtul SalesRegion Region { get; set; }   // This is the Property for the Model

		[Required]
		public int RegionId { get; set; }    // This is the property for the model's ID 

	***Notice the naming convention, this is important to use the same name so that Entity Framework can connect the two

CONNECTING TO MULTIPLE (many) MODELS
	You need to set up a collection property - here we used Observable List Source (for windows forms)
	For Web Application you can use ICollection

	Ex.
		public virtual ObservableListSource<Sale> Sales {get; set;}

		//Note that <Sale> is a class or object and Sales is what we are naming it for use later


C# COMMANDS/OPERATORS

?? Operator
		The ?? operator is called the null-coalescing operator. 
		It returns the left-hand operand if the operand is not null; otherwise it returns the right hand operand.


DATABASE CONTEXT
	Allows one to generte a Database

To add additional columns or items to DB after creation:
Go to TOOLS > NuGet Package Manager > Package Manager Console 
Type in "Add-Migration" and give it a name relavent to what you have done such as Sales Target
It should look like this:
PM> Add-Migration SalesTargets
Scaffolding migration 'SalesTargets'.
The Designer Code for this migration file includes a snapshot of your current Code First model. This snapshot is used to 
calculate the changes to your model when you scaffold the next migration. If you make additional changes to your model that 
you want to include in this migration, then you can re-scaffold it by running 'Add-Migration SalesTargets' again.

Then you need to Update the Database 
PM> Update-Database
Specify the '-Verbose' flag to view the SQL statements being applied to the target database.
